# plivo-php-bridge-voicemail

A PHP call bridge and voicemail application using the Plivo API.

This app was written awhile ago so it may need some updating to work.

## Installation

2. Download `class.phpmailer.php` and `class.smtp.php` https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer and place into `/lib`

3. Setup your configuration in `config.php`

4. The app records calls by default. This can be changed in `dial.php`
